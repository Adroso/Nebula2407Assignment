<p1>The dataset chosen is vehicle kilometres travelled from the years 1965 to 2012. It was taken from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. The dataset shows the total kilometres travelled for all vehicle types, car, motorcycle, trucks, and buses. And also all fuel types, petrol, diesel, LPG. I focused on the total kilometres travelled for the years 1965 to 2010.  
X = Year. 	Y = Vehicle Kilometres Travelled presented as billion kilometres (10^9 kilometres).
